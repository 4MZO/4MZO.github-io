        <h1>Happy Birthday To My Love, My Baby, My Everything, Celine!</h1>
        <font size="5">
        <p>To my baby, the woman who has my heart until the day i die, the one who i think about with every breath i take, the woman whose existence brings me unparalleled happiness and joy, i just want to say, HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYY!!!! </p>   
        <p>Celine. A name of elegance. A name of beauty. The name that belongs to the woman who is the finest creation to have ever existed. I hope that by now, you already know how much you mean to me, but until the day i die, i’ll never stop reminding you anyway, so here we go! </p>
        <p>Long before you came into my life, i asked Allah to bless me with a special woman, a woman that i dreamed of, but deep down i always had a feeling that this someone, who always seemed to good to be true, could never exist. Little did i know…</p>
        <p>As good as this person i pictured in my dreams seemed, never did i ever expect to meet someone who could defy the perfection that i had dreamed of. Little did i know, that a woman named Celine, would show me what perfection TRULY is.</p>
        <p>Celine, you are, always have been, and forever will be the love of my life. Ever since you entered my life, i have never had an ounce of doubt as to what i want our future to be. I have always known that you are the woman i want to spend the rest of my life with, the woman i want to grow old with and the woman i want to have a family with.</p>
        <p>I am so in love with you Celine, for so many reasons. I love you for the person you are. You’re so sweet, so caring, so loving, so forgiving, so humble, so selfless, so pure and so much more. To me, you are a bundle of light, because how you are as a human radiates no matter where you are. You’re so special in that sense and i love that about you.</p>
        <p>I love you for your intellect. You’re a woman with so much brains about you Celine. I know that i can talk to you about anything and you’ll always have knowledge about it, and even when you dont, you’ll always be willing to explore it! I love how smart you are, i feel proud to have a woman that knows so much and is so knowledgeable in so many things.</p>
        <p>I love you for your immense talent. Celine you have been blessed with immense talent, talent that reflects your beauty. Your talent when it comes to drawing, painting, singing, designing, cooking food, baking and the talents that you have which im yet to discover, seeing them makes me feel an unbelievable sense of pride. I love the fact that i have a woman who is capable of so many amazing things, i cant wait until the day where i can tell everyone i know about you and how special my baby is.</p>
        <p>I love you for your beauty. Celine your beauty needs no words, because no words in existence can do your beauty justice. You are the finest creation to have graced this earth. From your stunning face to your seductive body, your elegance, your beauty, it knows no match. I could stare at your face for every passing moment until i die, and i would have lived the happiest life possible. Every perfect detail of your face, every curve of your sexy body, they have been imprinted in my mind, so that with every breath i take, with every time my eyes blink, i can admire the woman who stands beside me in this life. The woman who i cherish and crave more than anything in life.</p>
        <p>I’ll always crave you Celine. I can never get enough of you. I have craved you every moment that i have known you, and i will forever crave you, even after we finally meet. I will forever crave you Celine because i know that no matter how much time we spend together, how old we grow together, how much we embrace each other throughout our lifetime, i will never have enough of you.</p>
        <p>You are my soulmate Celine, without a doubt. This is something i have known from the very moment i began to know you. Not a day goes past where i dont thank Allah for making us cross paths, because i can gladly and very easily say that encountering you has been the very best thing to ever occur in my life.</p>
        <p>You are a source of happiness for me, a source of motivation, and of course, a source of love. I cant wait to see you. To embrace you. To kiss you. To feel your warmth against my body. To run my fingers through your hair. To finally feel what my dream feels like. Because to me, you are a dream that has turned into reality.</p>
        <p>My love for you is ever-growing Celine, it will never cease, it will never diminish. I can easily say that i have never felt a love like this for anyone. The emotions you bring me are surreal, and hard to put into words, thats why i always say i cant wait to finally see you and put them into actions, because with these actions im sure you’ll finally get a better understanding of my true feelings towards you, the true extent of my love for you.</p>
        <p>You’re going to be the best wife and mother insha’Allah, and i cant wait for those chapters in our life to begin. I cant wait for the rest of our future together, insha’Allah it will be a great one, even better than these four amazing years we’ve already experienced together.</p>
        <p>Once again my love, my baby, my princess, my everything, my cece, i wish you a happy birthday! I pray you have a day filled with happiness celebrated between you and your close ones, and i hope you felt good reading all of this. I hope you enjoy the gifts i got you too and the rest of what i planned with creating this website for you ❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘</p>
