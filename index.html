        <h1>Happy Birthday To My Love, My Baby, My Everything, Celine!</h1>
        <p>Happy birthday my love. I'm sure you already know what you mean to me Celine, but it never hurts to remind you haha. Celine you are, always have been 
        and forever will be the love of my life. There is nobody i could ever imagine spending the rest of my life with. From the moment you came into my life, i knew
        what i wanted out future to be. I have always wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. You are a dream turned into reality. I always tell you how much i used to 
        dream of having a woman who sounds exactly like what you are, and it is all true. I am so into you Celine, i am so so so in love with you baby, not just because of your beauty
        but also because of you as a person. I crave you Celine. I have craved you every moment of these past four years and i'll continue to crave you for the rest of my life, even 
        after we meet, because i know that for as long as i live, for as old as we grow together, i will never be able to get enough of you. You are my soulmate Celine, without a doubt.
        I thank God every day for making us cross-paths, because it is the best moment in my life. You are a source of happiness for me, a source of motivation and a source of love. I cant wait
        to see you, to kiss you, to hold you, to feel your warmth and feel your love. I want you to feel how much i love you through my actions, not just my words, like you have done these past four years.
        My love for you grows every day Celine, it never ceases. I've never felt love for an individual like i do for you. </p>   
        
        <p>You're going to be the best wife and mother ever Insha'Allah. I cant wait for the rest of our future together.</p>

        <p>I hope you enjoyed that paragraph. This year i wanted to do something a little different. I know you enjoyed those little envelope notes i made for you, so 
        i made something similar but at least this time you can access it wherever you are, whenever you want. Maybe there'll be some secrets in here too, who knows?</p>
